This project uses maven to import netty version 4.1.43.Final which is affected by three vulnerabilities, CVE-2019-20444, CVE-2019-20445 and CVE-2020-11612. The first two are related to the webserver component, and the last one to decompression.
However, this particular project only makes use of the compression part of netty, and so we are unaffected by any vulnerabilities in the webserver component.
Normally we would seem to be affected by all vulnerabilities, but thanks to our Vulnerable Functionality analysis we know we are actually only affected by CVE-2020-11612, allowing us to safely ignore CVE-2019-20444 and CVE-2019-20445.
